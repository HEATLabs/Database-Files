As the player moves the turret, the machine guns adjust their aim, enabling semi-aimed suppressive fire while the main gun keeps firing.",

Thanks to a special engine, his vehicle's power output is greatly increased, but its agility is sacrificed. This lets Reaper lock in his aim and propel his tank toward opponents. While active, the ability reduces damage taken from ramming and allows him to push enemy vehicles with ease.",
