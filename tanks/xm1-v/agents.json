      "story": "A frontline fighter who calls in air support to hold the line. He is a bear of a man on his chrome-plated bike, but appearances deceive. Big personality, heart of gold: devoted to friends, lethal to enemies. A father figure to many Agents, he's a down-to-earth family man who signed up to provide for his kids' education, yet this practical soul has a literary quote ready for any moment. But cross this bear at your own peril.",
