      "description": "When you destroy the enemy, you gain a token out of them and recover some health, this works as a passive ability. When the ability is available, you can activate it, and Raketa will load collected scrap, using a rapid-fire shotgun to destroy enemies even faster.",
      "story": "A scavenger who uses enemy scrap to create deadly close-range weapons. He never shuts up, always cracking bad jokes and failing miserably at flirting with every woman in sight, but his real talent is turning random junk into deadly weapons. He lives for thrills and chaos, but stays ice-cold when things get rough. Don't be fooled by his jokes and games: he'll gladly sneak up on foes and stab them in the back, it's his specialty. He has done some nasty things in the past, all in the name of getting results, and he is not ashamed to admit it.",
